## Update v1.0.7: Uncapped FPS, better terrain lighting, and misc changes

the highlight of this update is the addition of a much-requested feature: uncapped FPS. this feature was developed for the GPU plugin by Adam, and is now available as a toggle in the HD plugin (under 'general' settings).

this update also brings some subtle improvements to terrain lighting. by default, the color of the terrain has lighting data baked into it from the OSRS software renderer. when we apply dynamic lighting on top of this, it creates some undesirable patches of extremely bright light. as of today's update, these bright patches are darkened (through a kind of messy and imperfect process) to help make the terrain a little easier on the eyes. in addition, terrain on the lowest plane will no longer cast shadows, to help reduce the incidence of ugly shadow artifacts. see the screenshot provided for a before/after comparison.

there have also been some miscellaneous changes made to environments, objects, and textures. the full changelog is below.
