## Update v1.0.4: Lighting improvements, macOS fix, and more

First of all: **THANK YOU!** as this is my first post here since release, I wanted to express my immense gratitude to all of you for your support over the past ~20 months

for those of you macOS users who experience major visual bugs when using the plugin, this update brings a fix. at the bottom of the plugin settings, expand the 'workarounds' section and enable the macOS fix. thanks to Hooder (on Discord) for this contribution!

this update also brings a fairly major (but often subtle) change to how lighting is calculated. previously, lighting was applied to colors in gamma color space. now, colors are converted to linear space before lighting is applied, then the result is converted back to gamma space before being displayed on the screen. this new method is physically accurate and should produce more natural-looking lighting, instead of the odd, high contrast, washed out lighting that would often give things a plastic-y appearance. all lighting had to be updated to facilitate this change, so be aware that there will be some places and things that look worse than before the update. your feedback is welcome!

beyond these changes, we've had some great contributions that add new lighting and improve settings, and new updates actively in the works.
