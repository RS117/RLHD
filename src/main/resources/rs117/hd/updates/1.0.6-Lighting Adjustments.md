## Update v1.0.6: Lighting adjustments, small improvements, and minor bugfixes

this is a minor update that mostly addresses problems and imbalances caused by the previous gamma/linear update, but also introduces some small improvements to lighting/materials. if you have been experiencing worse performance since the last update - particularly in areas with a lot of dynamic lights - this update will hopefully fix that regression.
lighting in many places has been rebalanced to bring the darker and brighter areas closer to a normalized average. as always, lighting overall is constantly changing and your feedback makes a difference.

## Updates
* improvements to linear-gamma space conversions
* convert textures to linear on load
* precompute gamma -> linear for lights, fog, etc.
